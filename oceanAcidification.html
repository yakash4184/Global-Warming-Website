			<p>Ocean acidification is the ongoing decrease in the pH of the Earth's oceans,
			 caused by the uptake of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.[2] Seawater
			  is slightly basic (meaning pH > 7), and ocean acidification involves a shift
				towards pH-neutral conditions rather than a transition to acidic conditions
				 (pH < 7).[3] An estimated 30–40% of the carbon dioxide from human activity
				  released into the atmosphere dissolves into oceans, rivers and lakes.
					 To achieve chemical equilibrium, some of it reacts with the water to form carbonic acid.
					 Some of the resulting carbonic acid molecules dissociate into a bicarbonate ion and a
					 hydrogen ion, thus increasing ocean acidity (H+ ion concentration). Between 1751 and
					  1996, surface ocean pH is estimated to have decreased from approximately 8.25 to 8.14,
						 representing an increase of almost 30% in H+ ion concentration in the world's
						 oceans. Earth System Models project that, within the last decade, ocean acidity
						  exceeded historical analogues[9] and, in combination with other ocean biogeochemical
							 changes, could undermine the functioning of marine ecosystems and disrupt the provision
							  of many goods and services associated with the ocean beginning as early as 2100.</p>

								<p>Increasing acidity is thought to have a range of potentially harmful
								consequences for marine organisms, such as depressing metabolic rates and
								immune responses in some organisms, and causing coral bleaching.
								By increasing the presence of free hydrogen ions, the additional carbonic
								 acid that forms in the oceans ultimately results in the conversion of
								  carbonate ions into bicarbonate ions. Ocean alkalinity (roughly equal
									 to [HCO3−] + 2[CO32−]) is not changed by the process, or may increase
									 over long time periods due to carbonate dissolution.
									  This net decrease in the amount of carbonate ions available may make
								 it more difficult for marine calcifying organisms, such as coral and
								  some plankton, to form biogenic calcium carbonate, and such structures
									 become vulnerable to dissolution. Ongoing acidification of the oceans
									  may threaten future food chains linked with the oceans. As members
										 of the InterAcademy Panel, 105 science academies have issued a statement
										 on ocean acidification recommending that by 2050, global CO2 emissions be
										  reduced by at least 50% compared to the 1990 level.</p>

							<p>While ongoing ocean acidification is at least partially anthropogenic in
								origin, it has occurred previously in Earth's history. The most notable
								 example is the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM), which occurred
								  approximately 56 million years ago when massive amounts of carbon entered
									 the ocean and atmosphere, and led to the dissolution of carbonate sediments
									 in all ocean basins.</p>

									 <p>Ocean acidification has been compared to anthropogenic
									  climate change and called the "evil twin of global
										warming" and "the other CO2 problem". Freshwater bodies also appear
										to be acidifying, although this is a more complex and less obvious
										 phenomenon. </p>
