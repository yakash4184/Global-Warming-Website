		Global warming is causing the Earth's temperature to rise. The average global temperature has increased by about 1.1 degrees Celsius (2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the pre-industrial era, primarily due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture.

The rise in temperature is causing numerous changes in the Earth's climate, including more frequent and severe heatwaves, changes in precipitation patterns, and more intense storms. It is also contributing to sea level rise and the loss of biodiversity.

The impacts of temperature rise due to global warming are already being felt around the world. In many regions, extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, and wildfires have become more common and severe. Rising temperatures are also affecting agriculture and food security, as crops are impacted by changes in rainfall and temperature patterns.

To address the problem of temperature rise due to global warming, it is important to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. This can involve actions such as increasing energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable transportation. It is also important to support policies and regulations that encourage businesses and governments to reduce their emissions and protect the environment.

In addition, individuals can take actions to reduce their own carbon footprint, such as using energy-efficient appliances, driving less or using public transportation, eating a plant-based diet, and supporting renewable energy projects. By working together, we can mitigate the impacts of global warming and create a more sustainable future.</br></br>
<center><b>About surface temperature</center></b>
The concept of an average temperature for the entire globe may seem odd. After all, at this very moment, the highest and lowest temperatures on Earth are likely more than 100°F (55°C) apart. Temperatures vary from night to day and between seasonal extremes in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. This means that some parts of Earth are quite cold while other parts are downright hot. To speak of the "average" temperature, then, may seem like nonsense. However, the concept of a global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget—how much sunlight Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time.

To calculate a global average temperature, scientists begin with temperature measurements taken at locations around the globe. Because their goal is to track changes in temperature, measurements are converted from absolute temperature readings to temperature anomalies—the difference between the observed temperature and the long-term average temperature for each location and date. Multiple independent research groups across the world perform their own analysis of the surface temperature data, and they all show a similar upward trend.

Across inaccessible areas that have few measurements, scientists use surrounding temperatures and other information to estimate the missing values. Each value is then used to calculate a global temperature average. This process provides a consistent, reliable method for monitoring changes in Earth's surface temperature over time.

<center><b>Global temperature in 2023</center></b>
According to the 2022 Global Climate Report from NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information, every month of 2022 ranked among the ten warmest for that month, despite the cooling influence from the La Niña climate pattern in the tropical Pacific. The "coolest" month was November, which was 1.35 ˚F (0.75 ˚C) warmer than average.</br>
