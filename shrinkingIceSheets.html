			The shrinking of ice sheets, particularly in Greenland and Antarctica, is one of the most visible and significant impacts of global warming. Ice sheets are large, slow-moving masses of ice that accumulate over thousands of years, and they play a critical role in regulating global sea levels.

As temperatures rise due to human activities, the ice sheets are melting at an accelerating rate. This melting contributes to rising sea levels, which threaten coastal cities and communities worldwide. The rate of ice loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, for example, has increased more than sevenfold since the 1990s, and Antarctica is losing ice at an increasing rate as well.

The melting of ice sheets also has impacts beyond sea level rise. For example, melting ice from Greenland is disrupting ocean currents and weather patterns, which can lead to more extreme weather events. It can also affect the biodiversity and ecosystems of the Arctic region, as well as the livelihoods of indigenous peoples who rely on the ice for hunting and transportation.

Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is critical to slowing the rate of ice sheet melting and mitigating its impacts. This can involve actions such as increasing energy efficiency, using renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable transportation. It is also important to support policies and regulations that encourage businesses and governments to reduce their emissions and protect the environment.

In addition, individuals can take actions to reduce their own carbon footprint, such as using energy-efficient appliances, driving less or using public transportation, eating a plant-based diet, and supporting renewable energy projects. By working together, we can mitigate the impacts of shrinking ice sheets and global warming and create a more sustainable future.</br></br>

<center><b><b>The Impacts
See how melting sea ice is already affecting us <b></center></b></b>
<b>1. Temperatures</b></br></b>
The Arctic and Antarctic are the world’s refrigerator. Since they are covered in white snow and ice that reflect heat back into space, they balance out other parts of the world that absorb heat. Less ice means less reflected heat, meaning more intense heatwaves worldwide. But it also means more extreme winters: as the polar jet stream—a high-pressure wind that circles the Arctic region—is destabilized by warmer air, it can dip south, bringing bitter cold with it.</br>
<b>2. Coastal communities</b></br></b>
Global average sea level has risen by about 7–8 inches since 1900 and it’s getting worse. Rising seas endanger coastal cities and small island nations by exacerbating coastal flooding and storm surge, making dangerous weather events even more so. Glacial melt of the Greenland ice sheet is a major predictor of future sea level rise; if it melts entirely, global sea levels could rise 20 feet.</br>
<b>3. Food</b></br>
Polar vortexes, increased heat waves, and unpredictability of weather caused by ice loss are already causing significant damage to crops on which global food systems depend. This instability will continue to mean higher prices for you and growing crises for the world’s most vulnerable</br>
<b>4. Shipping</b></br>
As ice melts, new shipping routes open up in the Arctic. These routes will be tempting time-savers, but incredibly dangerous. Imagine more shipwrecks or oil spills like the Exxon-Valdez in areas that are inaccessible to rescue or clean-up crews.</br>
<b>5. Wildlife</b></br>
When there’s less sea ice, animals that depend on it for survival must adapt or perish. Loss of ice and melting permafrost spells trouble for polar bears, walruses, arctic foxes, snowy owls, reindeer, and many other species. As they are affected, so too are the other species that depend on them, in addition to people. Wildlife and people are coming into more frequent contact – and often conflict – as wildlife encroach on Arctic communities, looking for refuge as their sea ice habitat disappears.</br>  
<b>6. Permafrost</b></br>
Arctic ice and permafrost—ground that is permanently frozen—store large amounts of methane, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. When it thaws, that methane is released, increasing the rate of warming. This, in turn, causes more ice and permafrost to thaw or melt, releasing more methane, causing more melting. As we lose more ice more quickly and see more rapid permafrost melt, we will start seeing the worst climate change predictions come true.</br>
